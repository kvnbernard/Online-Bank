# Online Bank - L3 Databases-Networks

**Creation of an online banking network as part of our Databases and Networks courses at CY Tech.**  
The aim is to offer the possibility of opening two types of account: a current account and savings accounts. It is possible to make payments and transfers between accounts belonging to the same user and between accounts belonging to different users. Users can view their latest transactions and the amounts in each of their accounts, as well as open new accounts and close existing ones.    

The network client simulates the operation of a payment terminal. The web browser lets you consult the status of your accounts, displaying the last transactions carried out, the total money available to the user, and the breakdown between accounts.
